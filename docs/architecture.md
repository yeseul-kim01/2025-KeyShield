# KeyShield Architecture

KeyShield is a browser-first DLP platform designed with a Zero Trust-style separation:
- PEP: Chrome Extension (enforcement)
- PDP: Spring Boot (decision + policy management)
- PIP: Python (context + risk automation)

This document will evolve as the implementation progresses.
